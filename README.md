# Order Robot

Robot ordering robot for Robocorp's Certificate II.

Instructions and more details in [Robocorp's site](https://robocorp.com/docs/courses/build-a-robot).

## Running the robot

I'm running this project with [Robocorp's RCC tool](https://github.com/robocorp/rcc).

I think it should work with importing the required RPA Libraries and running

```sh
$ robot tasks.robot
```
